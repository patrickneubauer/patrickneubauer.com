            <p>Patrick Neubauer is currently associated with the <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/es/">Enterprise Systems Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/">University of York</a> in the UK, where he works on polyglot and hybrid persistence architectures for big data analytics in the <a href="https://www.typhon-project.org">TYPHON</a> project funded under the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant agreement No. 780251). He is one of the main developers of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3341909">Crossflow</a>—a distributed data processing framework that supports dispensation of work across multiple opinionated and low-commitment workers developed within the context of the <a href="https://www.crossminer.org">CROSSMINER</a> project. Previously, he worked at the <a href="https://www.big.tuwien.ac.at/">Business Informatics Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.tuwien.ac.at/">Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)</a> in Vienna, Austria, in the context of the European research project <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/136130/en">ARTIST</a>, i.e. funded under the FP7 objective "Cloud Computing, Internet of Services and advanced software engineering".</p>
            <br />
            <p>His current research focuses on the extraction of knowledge from open-source repositories, such as GitHub and StackOverflow, and particularly the construction of a model-based workflow language as well as the automated generation of resilient clients for automated and efficient execution of workflow specifications that involve the extraction, analysis, and monitoring of repository data.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In 2017, he has been awarded the <a href="https://oead.at/en/outgoing/higher-education/scholarships-for-studying-abroad/marietta-blau-grant/">Marietta Blau Grant</a> that funded research in the area of domain-specific language engineering and especially the modernization of domain-specific languages by bridging the technical spaces of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/11663430_17">grammarware and modelware</a> in collaboration with <a href="../~paige/index.html">Richard Paige</a> and <a href="../~dkolovos/index.html">Dimitris Kolovos</a> and under the supervision of <a href="https://big.tuwien.ac.at/people/mwimmer/">Manuel Wimmer</a>. The results of this research are partially published by the means of <a href="http://xmltext.big.tuwien.ac.at">XMLText</a>, <a href="http://intelledit.big.tuwien.ac.at">IntellEdit</a>, <a href="http://xmlintelledit.big.tuwien.ac.at">XMLIntellEdit</a>, i.e. a combination and extension of the previous frameworks, and <a href="ecss/index.html">ECSS</a>.</p>
            <br />
            <p>During his engagement as Senior Lecturer at the TU Wien, he administered and supported the execution of several undergraduate-level and graduate-level academic courses and seminars in the area of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), such as <a href="https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseAnnouncement.xhtml?dswid=4694&amp;dsrid=590&amp;courseNumber=188391&amp;courseSemester=2016S">Object-Oriented Modeling</a>, <a href="https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?courseNr=188923&amp;semester=2017W&amp;dswid=7708&amp;dsrid=771">Model Engineering</a>, and <a href="https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?courseNr=188953&amp;semester=2017S&amp;dswid=5096&amp;dsrid=982">Advanced Model Engineering</a>.</p>
            <br />
            <p>From 2015, he participated in establishing and conducting a collaborative research project with the University of Zurich, funded by the <a href="">technology transfer organization of the Universities of Basel, Bern, and Zurich</a>, a novel <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2016184823">method and system for monitoring a patient's medical condition</a>.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In 2014 he received his graduate degree in Business Informatics from TU Wien for his thesis on the <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1236/paper-05.pdf">integration of modeling and programming languages</a> by focusing on the case of UML and Java. From 2012, he worked as an industrial software engineer and consultant for <a href="http://www.ebcont-et.com">EBCONT enterprise technologies</a>.</p>
            <br />
            <p>He conducted his undergraduate studies in Applied Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.unibz.it">Free University of Bozen-Bolzano</a> in South Tyrol—a primarily Austrian/German-speaking region in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/patrickneubauer/sets/72157671407355036">the heart of the Italian Apennine mountains</a>. During this time, he has been awarded to participate in a <a href="https://www.unibz.it/en/applicants/exchange-programmes/bilateral-agreements-programme/">bilateral exchange program</a> between the Free University of Bolzano and the <a href="http://www.cofc.edu/">College of Charleston</a> in South Carolina, USA.</p>
